When I moved to Germany, I had the chance of decorating my own room, therefore, LED lights were a must. After learning some microcontrollers and coding knowledge, I knew I could tinker with my LED strips. Unfortunately, the first step was to break the IR LED Driver box that came with strip, in order to look at the circuitâ€¦ solely for research purposes, of course.
